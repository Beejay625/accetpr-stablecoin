# Test Script Fixes

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Response Validation Bug
The test script was checking for `response.success` but your API actually returns `response.ok`.

**Changed:**
```typescript
❌ (response) => response.success && Array.isArray(response.data)
✅ (response) => response.ok && Array.isArray(response.data)
```

**All validation functions updated** across:
- Product routes
- Unique name routes  
- Wallet routes

## 📊 Understanding Your Test Results

From your previous test run, here's what's happening:

### ✅ Tests That Should Now Pass (Were False Failures)
These were getting correct status codes but failing validation:
- **Get All Products (page 1)** - Was [200], will now pass ✓
- **Get All Products (page 1, limit 5)** - Was [200], will now pass ✓
- **Get Product Statistics** - Was [200], will now pass ✓
- **Check Unique Name Availability** - Was [200], will now pass ✓

### ⚠️ Tests That Need API Investigation
These are actual API errors that need to be looked at:

#### 1. **Create Product** - Getting 422 validation error
```
Expected: 201 (Created)
Got: 422 (Validation Error)
```
**Possible causes:**
- Missing required fields in validation
- Field format issues (amount, slug, etc.)
- Database constraints

**To debug:** Run with `--verbose` to see exact validation error

#### 2. **Check Invalid Unique Name** - Not rejecting invalid input
```
Expected: 400/422 (Bad Request)
Got: 200 (Success)
```
**Issue:** API is accepting invalid unique names
**Fix needed:** Update unique name validation schema

#### 3. **Wallet Balance** - Getting 422
```
Expected: 200 (Success)
Got: 422 (Validation Error)
```
**Possible causes:**
- Missing wallet address connected
- User needs to set up wallet first

#### 4. **Transaction Routes** - Getting 500 errors
```
All chain transactions returning 500 Internal Server Error
```
**Possible causes:**
- BlockRadar API connection issues
- Missing wallet address
- API key issues
- Error in transaction fetching logic

**Critical:** These 500 errors need investigation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Run Tests Again
With the fix, run tests again:
```bash
npm run test:routes -- --token=YOUR_CLERK_TOKEN
```

### 2. Expected Improved Results
You should see pass rate increase from **45%** to approximately **65-70%**.

### 3. Debug Remaining Failures

#### For 422 Validation Errors:
```bash
npm run test:routes -- --token=YOUR_TOKEN --verbose 2>&1 | grep -A 10 "422"
```

#### For 500 Internal Errors:
```bash
# Check server logs
tail -f server.log

# Run tests and watch server
npm run test:routes -- --token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### 4. Fix API Issues

#### Create Product 422:
Check `src/routes/protected/product/index.ts` schema validation

#### Wallet 500 Errors:
Check:
1. `src/services/wallet/transactionsService.ts`
2. BlockRadar API connection
3. Database wallet records

#### Invalid Unique Name Accepting:
Update validation in `src/routes/public/schemas/uniqueName.schema.ts`

## 📋 Test Categories

### Should Pass Now (Fixed Validation)
- ✅ Get All Products (both pagination tests)
- ✅ Get Product Statistics  
- ✅ Check Unique Name Availability

### Already Passing
- ✅ Create Product with Missing Fields (422)
- ✅ Get Non-existent Product (404)
- ✅ Set Unique Name (200)
- ✅ Set Invalid Unique Name (422)
- ✅ Set Special Characters (422)
- ✅ Single Withdrawal - Invalid Data (422)
- ✅ Batch Withdrawal - Invalid Data (422)
- ✅ Single Withdrawal - Complete Data (422)

### Need Investigation
- ⚠️ Create Product (422 instead of 201)
- ⚠️ Check Invalid Unique Name (200 instead of 400/422)
- ⚠️ Wallet Balance (422 instead of 200)
- 🚨 Get Transactions - All chains (500 errors)

## 🐛 Debugging Commands

### See All Response Details
```bash
npm run test:routes -- --token=YOUR_TOKEN --verbose
```

### Test Specific Category
You can modify the script to comment out test suites you don't want to run.

### Check Server Logs
```bash
# In one terminal
npm run dev

# In another terminal
npm run test:routes -- --token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

## 📊 Expected Pass Rate

| Before Fix | After Fix | Target |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| 45% (9/20) | ~65-70% (13-14/20) | 100% (20/20) |

## 🔍 Investigation Priority

1. **High Priority** - 500 Errors (Critical bugs)
   - Transaction endpoints
   
2. **Medium Priority** - Feature Issues
   - Create Product validation
   - Wallet balance check
   
3. **Low Priority** - Validation Enhancement
   - Invalid unique name should be rejected

## 💡 Tips

### For Create Product Issues
Make sure all required fields match schema:
- `productName` (string)
- `description` (string)
- `amount` (string, valid number)
- `payoutChain` (valid chain: base/solana/tron)
- `payoutToken` (valid token: USDC/USDT)
- `slug` (valid format, unique per user)
- `linkExpiration` ('never' or 'custom_days')

### For Wallet Issues
User needs to:
1. Have connected a wallet address
2. Chain must be configured
3. BlockRadar API must be accessible

### For Transaction 500 Errors
Check error logs for:
- BlockRadar API errors
- Database query failures
- Missing environment variables

## 🎯 Summary

**Main Fix:** Changed `response.success` to `response.ok` in all validation functions to match your API's actual response structure.

**Result:** This should fix ~4-5 false-negative tests that were actually passing but marked as failed.

**Remaining Issues:** Investigate the 500 errors and 422 validation errors using verbose mode and server logs.

Run the tests again and you should see much better results! 🚀
