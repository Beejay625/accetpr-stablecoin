## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Status Grouping:
```typescript
initiated:   INITIATED
processing:  PROCESSING + PENDING + REQUIRES_ACTION + MICRODEPOSITS_VERIFIED
succeeded:   SUCCEEDED
failed:      FAILED
cancelled:   CANCELLED
```

### Amount Conversion:
```typescript
// Database stores in cents
amount: 29999  // cents

// Service converts to dollars
amount: "299.99"  // string in dollars
```

### Total Calculation:
```typescript
total.amount = sum of all statuses
total.count = count of all payment intents
```

## 🧪 Testing

```typescript
'Get Payment Earnings' test validates:
✓ Response has ok: true

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Dashboard Earnings Display
```javascript
// Fetch earnings
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/protected/payment/earnings', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});

const { data } = await response.json();

// Display
console.log(`Total Earnings: $${data.total.amount}`);
console.log(`Successful Payments: $${data.succeeded.amount} (${data.succeeded.count})`);
```

### 2. Analytics
```javascript
// Calculate success rate
const successRate = (data.succeeded.count / data.total.count) * 100;
console.log(`Success Rate: ${successRate}%`);

// Calculate pending revenue
const pending = parseFloat(data.initiated.amount) + parseFloat(data.processing.amount);
console.log(`Pending Revenue: $${pending.toFixed(2)}`);
```

### 3. Revenue Reporting
```javascript
// Show revenue breakdown
console.log('Revenue Breakdown:');
console.log(`  Completed: $${data.succeeded.amount}`);
console.log(`  Pending: $${data.processing.amount}`);
console.log(`  Lost (failed): $${data.failed.amount}`);
console.log(`  Lost (cancelled): $${data.cancelled.amount}`);
```
